My name is Devin Ford. I am a programmer with 8 years of professional
experience in game development and backend server development. This is a site
where I plan to post and document some of my on-going hobby projects.

I work on game development and recreational mathematics projects as hobbies. The
posts on this site are most likely to be related to game development, reversible
computing, or software development in general.

The current ongoing major features on the site are:

- [The Reversible Programming Primer series](/category/reversible_primer/) - An ongoing series breaking down reversible computing into a more digestable formfactor for programmers familiar with conventional programming languages.
- Daily Puzzle Games - Two puzzle games, [Pair Place](/browser-games/pair-place/) and [Triple Place](/browser-games/triple-place/) are updated daily with new puzzles.
